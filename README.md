# Tube

A iOS/macOS client for [Invidious](https://invidious.io), providing a native SwiftUI app for watching YouTube videos. 
It currently requires iOS 17+/macOS 14+, due to me wanting to try out `Observation` and `SwiftData`. 
Since it is just for my own personal use, backwards compatibility is not a concern – but I am willing to change that if 
there is interest.
